# STOCKPREDICTIONANALYSIS
In this project, we have worked with historical data about the stock prices of a publicly listed company. We have implemented a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company, starting with simple algorithms like multiple linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA(Time Series Forecasting) and LSTM. Furthermore, in order to make the algorithm more accurate we have mapped the algorithms with the Public Sentiments.
The Algorithms used to predict the future stock of a company is: </br></br>
• Multiple Linear Regression </br>
• Auto ARIMA </br>
• LSTM(Long short-term memory)
